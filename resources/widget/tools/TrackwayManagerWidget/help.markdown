Constructs and manages transform node based trackway representations in Maya.

Building Trackways
------------------
To construct a trackway, select a series (2 or more) transform nodes representing consecutive
foot prints for a specific limb, such as the left hindlimb and then click the

 * *Trackway Modifier* -> *Add*

button. This will construct a trackway segment from these nodes in the order they were selected.
If any nodes were already part of a trackway they will be removed from that previous trackway and
added here. If the first or last selected transform nodes are already part of a trackway segment,
this new segment selection will be added to the that existing segment.

Removing Prints
---------------
A print or prints can be removed from a trackway at any time by selecting the print(s) and clicking
the

 * *Trackway Modifier* -> *Remove*

 button.

Navigation
----------
The trackway navigation section allows for easy browsing of trackways using forward and back
navigation as well as footprint information section that shows the relationships for the current
trackway.
